    <h2>Welcome To My hobbies Page</h2>
    When Iâ€™m not busy learning to code or managing a warehouse, Iâ€™m indulging in a variety of hobbies that help me recharge and keep my creativity flowing. Whether itâ€™s jamming out to music, diving into a good book, exploring new worlds through movies, or conquering the latest video game, I know how to balance work and play. Here are a few things I enjoy in my downtime:
    <ol>
        <li>Reading</li>
        <br><li>Listening to music</li>
        <br><li>Watching movies</li>
        <br><li>Video Gaming</li>
        <br><li>Coding</li>
    </ol>
    <!--
  And yes, Iâ€™m pretty sure my skills in coding and gaming are about to make me the next tech superhero! But for now, Iâ€™m just here living my best life, one hobby at a time. 
  Who needs a cape when you have a good playlist and a great game to play? ðŸ˜ŽðŸŽ®ðŸŽ¶
